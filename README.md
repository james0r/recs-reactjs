This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This app was written by James Auble for The Hour of History Podcast. It simply fetches all book recommendations from the Hour of History Wordpress site and displays them in a table. Book covers link to Amazon pages where the book can be purchased.

Technologies used by this app are:

React
Axios
Bootstrap
& of course all of the under the hood tools used by Create-react-app.
